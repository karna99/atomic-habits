## Know your habits
To build new habits or change your habits, fist of all it is very helpful to be aware of your present habits. Just be being aware of your current habits you can then label them as positive habit , negative habits or just neutral habits.
you can add new habits in between your current habits, or modify your current habits such that it will discourage you from your current habbits that you are trying to avoid, there are alot of more fun and productive things that you can do just by being aware of your habits

__Habit Scorecard__ is one such method that helps you to become aware of your habits
First of all, write down all your habits from morning till you hit the bed, or you can make it short however you like
it looks something like this:
``` 
    1.Wake up
    2.Turn off Alarm
    3.Check my Phone
    4.Goto washroom
    5.make coffee
    
    ... and so on
   ```

Now mark your habits using
``` 
    (+) for positive habits
    (=) for neutral habits
    (-) for negative habits
    ```
    
Note: habits being positve, negative and neutral is different for eveyone, _for someone trying to lose weight eating extra desert can bad habit, but for someone trying to bulk up the same habit can be good habit_
