Tiny changes, remarkable resuluts

first of all lets talk about fundamentals 
what is atomic habits, why does it work and how does it work
a) the 1% rule, what progress is really like, the plateu of latent potential
b) systems over goals
c) why we fail in changing habits
  i) we try to change the wrong thing (identity over results)
  ii) we try to change habits in wrong way ( use cue,craving,response,reward method )
  

then lets talk about the 4method cycle rule( cue, craving, response, reward)
a) cue/ make it obvious/make it invisible/ noticing
b) craving/ make it attractive/ make it unattractive/ wanting,desire
c) response/ make it easy/ make it difficult/ doing
d) reward/ make it satisfying/ make it unsatisfying/ liking

a.1) be aware of your habits, pointing and calling, habit scorecard
a.2) make it obvious, 
      most common cues are time and location, i will do this at [time] in [location]
      habit stacking, will do [current habit] after [new habit]
      motivation is overrated, environment often matters more, prep your environment, your environment becomes the cue
      it is easir to build new habits in new environment, or rearrage your enivronment
a.3) secret to self-control,
      prep environment, can't beat temptation with selfcontrol alone
      make it invisible, reduce cues to bad habit
      optimize your environment rather than powering it through willpower alone, cut the problem at its root
      
 b.1) make it attractive, desire is the engine that drives behaviour
      anticipation and process of doing habit gives dopamine spike, so desire is very important, it is why we do habit in the first place
      habit stacking + temptation bundling
      after [current habit], i will [habit i need]
      after [habit i need], i will [habbit i want]
      
 b.2) role of society
      behaviours are attractive when they help us fit in, eg smoking
     we tend to adopt habits that are praised and approved by the tribe we have strong desire to fit in and belong to
     we tend to imiate, the close, the tribe, the powerful
     best thing to do is to find or join culture or tribe where:
          1)our desired behaviour is the normal behaviour
          2)we already have something common with the group
          if we join such group and good at it, it only further reinforces our habit
          
  b.3) habits are attrative when we associate them with positive feelings
        habits are modern day soultion to our ancient root desires
        highlight benefit of good habit and highlight benefit of avoiding bahd habit 
        associate your good habit with positive feeling
        
  c.1) best is the enemy of good, don't try to perfect and optimize just put your reps in, get started practise dont plan
       habit formation takes place by repitition, it becomes automatic by repition not by planning
      
  c.2) the law of least effort
       we as human try to preserve energy, 
       create environment where doing right thig is easy and wrong thing hard
   
   c.3) used 2second rule to stop procastinating
         habits can bescaled down to 2 minutes, just to get started
         once you do these habits automatic, you will follow through your intended habits as well
         
   c.4) use commitment device , choice you make in present that locks in better behavior in the future
        onetime choices that last long time or even lifetime
        use techonology like site blocker etc
        
   d.1) what is rewarded is repeated, what is punished is avoided
        we prioritize immediate reward over dalyed rewards, use this to your advantage
        habit needs to be satisfying in order for a habit to be repeated.
        
    d.2) one of the most satisfying feeling is feeling of making progress, use habit tracker
          habit tracker can be cue, craving  and reward itself
          dont break the chain, don't miss a habit twice
          
    d.3) accountability partner and habit contract
          telling habit to others can help us maintain it cause we don't want to fall on their eyes
          knowing someone is watching can be powerful motivator, expecting even more
          roger meaning "received , orders given, expect result" powerful line from david goggins, next book i gotta read can't hurt me
          
          
 e) down side of habits
    upside of habits is that they are automatic but one downside is that we stop paying attention to little errors
    thats why we gotta review and refine our habits from time to time, just to keep them in check
    
  habits are easier when they align with your natural abilities, your identy
  use multiple habits and behaviour to build skills, use multiple skill sets and combine them into one that is unique and specific
  use goldilock rule that is "human experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities"
  stick to shedule, even when its boring, thats what seperates professionals from amatures
