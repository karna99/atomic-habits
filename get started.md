## Know your habits
To build new habits or change your habits, fist of all it is very helpful to be aware of your present habits. Just be being aware of your current habits you can then label them as positive habit , negative habits or just neutral habits.
you can add new habits in between your current habits, or modify your current habits such that it will discourage you from your current habbits that you are trying to avoid, there are alot of more fun and productive things that you can do just by being aware of your habits

__Habit Scorecard__ is one such method that helps you to become aware of your habits
First of all, write down all your habits from morning till you hit the bed, or you can make it short however you like
it looks something like this:
``` 
    1.Wake up
    2.Turn off Alarm
    3.Check my Phone
    4.Goto washroom
    5.make coffee
    
    ... and so on
   ```

Now mark your habits using
``` 
    (+) for positive habits
    (=) for neutral habits
    (-) for negative habits
```
    
__Note__: habits being positve, negative and neutral is different for eveyone, _for someone trying to lose weight eating extra desert can bad habit, but for someone trying to bulk up the same habit can be good habit_

After marking your habits it might look something like this:
```
    1.Wake up            =
    2.Turn off Alarm     =
    3.Check my Phone     - 
    4.Goto washroom      =
    5.make coffee        +
    
    ... and so on
  
```

Once you become of your habits, First of all just be aware of them, don't lie to yourself.
if you smoked even a few puff of cigarette be aware, don't try to brush it off, just be aware, once we are aware of our habits then only can we change them
Perform habits that help you become type of person you want to become, just think of these habits as vote, and does your habit vote toward the type of person you want to become or against it, perform more of habits that you marked good and less of habits that you marked minus and over time you'll see the reward, but it is easier said then done so below some methods you can follow that can help you with that

## Cues for your Habit (noticing)
Cues are the triggers that trigger our habits, if you are trying to build a new habit for a habit to be automatic it should be associated with a cue.
when you notice certain criteria we often do the habit automatically, that's cue

#### 1. Implementation Intentions
One of the most powerful cue is Time and another Location, we can use time and location as cues to trigger our habits

> eg: I have a habit of __working out__ at __6-7 PM__ in __My Gym__.

This method is called __Implementation Intentions__ where you tell or write early what you are going to do __Where (location)__ and at __What time__
it doesn't seem much but trust me it's very effective, once the clock hits 5:30 ish, i know its working out time, i haven't missed a day in a row since i have started doing this, it becomes automatic, once time comes and you are at the intended location you will perform your habit

```Just perform your habit as:
I will [ do this habit ] at [location] in [time]
```

#### 2. Habit Stacking
Another poweful Cue to your new habit can be your other habits
find a habit you already do each day and then stack your new behavior on top of it.
In other words, your current habit becomes the trigger for your new one
This method is called __Habit stacking__

> eg: After I workout, I'll wash my socks

You can even chain them like
> After I workout, I'll wash my socks
> After I wash my socks, I'll tidy my room
> After I tidy my room, I'll start studying
> and so on ..

the pervious habit becomes the Cue for the next habit, After coming form gym i'll automatically notice to wash my socks and so on
you can stack your habits big or small, but stacking 2-3 habits works great for me

``` so the mantra is:
After [ Current habit], I will [New habit]

If you are finding it hard to complete your habits, i could be because then habit stack is too long or you don't perform each hait every day. for eg gym's are closed on saturday, so i use time and location as cue study on saturdays ( i don't but as a example ðŸ˜‰)
Another reason could be because of there is no craving, you don't feel motivated enough, we can used temptation( tasks we like) to our use
``` It goes something like:
1. After [Current Habit], I will [ Habit I need]
2. After [Habit I  need], I will [ Habit I want]

eg: After [dinner], i will [do my dishes]
    After [do my dishes], i will [check facebook feed]
```
see , here i didn't want to do dishes but when there is temptation associated with it we do it and later on it becomes a habit

### Track your habits
Tracking your habits can be very beneficial because it can act as a cue to your habit, the process of marking X on your tracker or calander is also satisfying so in anticipation to cross it off the list, it can act as a reason or craving to perform your habit too, also once you've completed your habit crossing it off can be very satisfying which leads to doing it again and again
We'll talk about the habit Loop ( cue, craving, response, reward) on next topic, where I'll talk in detail rather than just how to get started.
